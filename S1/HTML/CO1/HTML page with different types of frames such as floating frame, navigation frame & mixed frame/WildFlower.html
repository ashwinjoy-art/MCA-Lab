<h3><b><u>Wild Flower</u></b></h3>
<p>
I yearned for the flames</br>
I yearned for a beautiful fall</br>
Even before the start, I imagined</br>
An end where I could applaud and smile</br>
That's what I wishеd for</br>
When everything I bеlieved in grew distant</br>
When all this fame turned into shackles</br>
Please take my desire away from me</br>
No matter what it takes</br>
Oh, let me be myself</br>
Oh, every day and every night</br>
Persistin' pain and the criminal mind</br>
Nights the beating of my heart kept me up</br>
The mournful crescent moon hung beyond the window</br>
I do wish me a lovely night</br>
Over my status is an oversized life</br>
Desperately holding onto a balloon drifting by</br>
I ask where you could be right now</br>
Where you go, where's your soul</br>
Yo, where's your dream?</br>
</br>
Gonna scatter across that sky</br>
Light a flower, flowerwork</br>
Flower, flowerwork</br>
Gonna shine across that sky</br>
Light a flower, flowerwork</br>
Flower, flowerwork</br>
